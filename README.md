# Testing screened modified gravity with SDSS-IV-MaNGA


This repository contains the main jupyter notebooks used to produce the analysis in the paper [Testing screened modified gravity with SDSS-IV-MaNGA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08825). 

It is necessary to run a selected samplle of galaxies (.fits file in this folder) with the NIRVANA version avalailable [here](https://github.com/ricardoclandim/NIRVANA/tree/asymdrift)  

This code can be freely used, as long as you cite the specific release paper ([Landim et al, 2024][(](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08825)))
