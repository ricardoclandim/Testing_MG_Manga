# Testing screened modified gravity with SDSS-IV-MaNGA


This repository contains the main jupyter notebooks used to produce the analysis in the paper ([Testing screened modified gravity with SDSS-IV-MaNGA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05807)). 

It is necessary to run a selected samplle of galaxies (.fits file in this fodler) with the NIRVANA version avalailable [here](https://github.com/ricardoclandim/NIRVANA/tree/asymdrift)  

This code can be freely used, as long as you cite the specific release paper ([Landim et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05807))
